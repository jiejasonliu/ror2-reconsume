# [Reconsume](https://thunderstore.io/package/jiejasonliu/Reconsume/)

Survivors of the Void brings consumable items; but unfortunately, they feel underwhelming.\
Reconsume **restores consumed items at the beginning of each stage** and **allows them to be scrappable**.

## Features

- Restore consumed `power elixir`, `delicate watch`, and `dio's best friend`<sup><i>(off by default)</i></sup> at the beginning of each stage
- Allow consumed `power elixir`, `delicate watch`, and `dio's best friend`<sup><i>(off by default)</i></sup> to be scrappable
- Adjust heal strength of the power elixir to 25% max health for balancing
- Highly configurable
	- Change whether an item can be scrappable or refilled at the beginning of each stage
	- Change the heal strength of the `power elixir` for balancing
